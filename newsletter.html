      <h2>Halloween Mid-Term Newsletter <span> <h5>1 Nov, 2022</h5> </span> </h2>
      
      <p>Welcome to our Mid-Term newsletter, this is our first ever newsletter. But before we start with what has happened over the past few weeks we’d like to introduce ourselves. <br><br>

We are a team of six transition year students competing in F1 in Schools Ireland, this is our first year of what we hope will be a long journey. We are only the second team in are school to be competing in this competition. <br><br>

We aim to produce a newsletter like this at the end of every school term. We hope that you enjoy this read.
</p>
      <h5>Primary F1 in Schools</h5>
      <p>Over the past two weeks, we have reached out to our local primary school regarding a STEM initiative. After having several meetings with the school’s management our program was given the green light. <br><br>

We created a 6 session based competition that would develop the students’ “soft skills” for example Communication, Team Work, Leadership and Critical Thinking.<br><br>

We are now working with 108 young students, who are between 8-9 years old. Each of the students are loving the program and is looking forward to learning more during our upcoming sessions. <br><br>

So far we have completed two initial sessions with the students and we are waiting on parts and supplies that we need for our future engineering classes. <br><br>
The next classes will be focused on building and developing the students skills & knowledge regarding aerodynamics, design, manufacturing and digital literacy.
</p>

<h5>Session 1 & 2,</h5>
<p>During the first session, we organised the students into groups. Each class had around 27 students so on average there were 7 groups per class (6 groups of 4 and 1 group of 3). <br><br>

We first explained what we were doing there and what F1 in schools is and what they will be doing in the coming weeks. Each student got to pick their role out of the 4 to choose from. We had a Team Manager, Graphic Designer, Design Engineer and Manufacturing Engineer. <br><br>

There were four roles so for the team with 3 one of our team members helped them throughout the session.  We then gave them some homework sheets to keep them busy until Session 2. <br><br>

In Session 2 we worked on their marketing skills and some key terms they could use to convince us to sponsor them at the end of the module. <br><br>

So, we played a short video for them explaining what they were to do and then proceeded to do an exercise where they attempted to sell us an item in their pencil case.<br><br>

We went around to the different groups and explained to them how to sell something to us. We explained some key points needed in a sales pitch. The groups had some very creative reasons to have a pen for example: “You need a pen to write, if you can’t write you can’t get into college, if you can’t get into college you can’t get a job and if you can’t get a job you will have no money. That is why you need to buy this pen.” <br><br>

We then had a brainstorm session where the groups could write down ideas for their car and their logo before wrapping up Session 2.<br><br>
</p>

<h5>Sponsorship,</h5>

<p>Regarding sponsorships we have launched our initial sponsorship campaign, attempting to make contact with many different companies. Our team is continuing to reach out to companies that would be interested in sponsoring us. <br><br>

We have generated a sponsorship prospectus detailing all of the benefits we offer prospective sponsors. We aim to work with companies that are aligned with our values and mission, Companies that promote Science, Technology and Engineering and Companies that promote STEM education in primary schools. <br><br>

If you feel that your company would be interested in sponsoring our team, please email us at jack.drumm@orbitracing.ie with any information. <br><br>
</p>

<h5>Social Media & Marketing,</h5>
<p>Over the last few months we have been growing as a team, and we have been documenting our growth on social media through our team’s Instagram account. We have created posts about important events such as “Environment Day” or shared motivational messages that have helped and inspired our team. 
<br><br>
We have also used “Stories” a feature that lets us share all the moments of our day. As you share multiple photos and videos, they appear together in a slideshow format: your story. We use this feature to give insight into all of our team meetings.<br><br>
 
In all of our posts, we aim to promote our team’s image and brand. We show off all the work we do at the moment in our Primary School STEM project and the fun we have during our team meetings and outings.  <br><br>
</p>

<h5>Car Design & Manufacturing,</h5>
<p>Our two engineers on our F1 in Schools team are Conor and Oliver, Conor is focused on the Manufacturing of the car while Oliver is focused on the Design.  <br><br>

So far Conor and Oliver have been working on the basic design of the body of the car on Fusion 360, a computer-aided design (CAD) & computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) design software. <br><br>

They have been learning how the software works and are developing their skills needed to use it. <br><br>

The engineers are challenged to work within F1 in Schools Ireland’s Rules and Regulations. <br><br>

The next objective is to find a software to use to run Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) test. This will be used to test the car’s drag and overall performance on the track.
</p>

<h5>Conclusion</h5>
<p>Thank you for reading our first-ever newsletter, we look forward to the weeks ahead as we begin our journey through this competition.  <br><br>

We would like to thank everyone who has supported us so far,  <br><br>

But specifically, we would like to thank Willow Park Junior School for allowing us to develop a STEM program that will be used during Science Week each year for the next few years. And finally, our Facilitator Ms Drew, they have always given us great advice and constant support. <br><br>

Until next time, Thank you. <br><br>

Darragh, Conor, Oliver, Fiachra, Philip and Jack, <br><br>
